// JavaScript is dynamically typed, 
// which means that the interpreter assigns a variable's type at runtime based on the value of the variable


//Primitives - they support call by value,  that is a copy is sent

//7 : String, Number , Boolean , null , undefined , symbol , BigInt

//Refence(non-primitives) - call by reference, that is changes are made in the original

//Arrays , Objects and functions

const heros = ["ironman" , "hulk" , "Thor"]

let obj = {
    name : "Smriti",
    age : 30,
}

const myFunction = function(){
    console.log("Hello World!!")
}

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

//MEMORY- of two types
//Stack(primitive)
//Heap(Non-Primitive)
